The Random Bibleizer randomly chooses a bible book & chapter for you to read today. Why would you want this? Simple: it allows God to give you more guidance over what you're reading than following some reading plan. This page cycles through every single chapter in the bible about once every 5 seconds, so all you have to do is ask God to guide when you press the "select" button, to provide you with something useful.
